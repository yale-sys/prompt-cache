It’s the first Friday of the month, when for one ever-so-brief moment the interests of Wall Street, Washington and Main Street are all aligned on one thing: Jobs. \n \n A fresh update on the U.S. employment situation for January hits the wires at 8:30 a.m. New York time offering one of the most important snapshots on how the economy fared during the previous month. Expectations are for 203,000 new jobs to be created, according to economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires, compared to 227,000 jobs added in February.

The unemployment rate dipped, but mostly because more Americans stopped looking for work. \n \n The Labor Department says the economy added 120,000 jobs in March, down from more than 200,000 in each of the previous three months. \n \n The unemployment rate fell to 8.2 percent, the lowest since January 2009. The rate dropped because fewer people searched for jobs. The official unemployment tally only includes those seeking work. \n \n The economy has added 858,000 jobs since December _ the best four months of hiring in two years. But Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has cautioned that the current hiring pace is unlikely to continue without more consumer spending.

"To be honest with you, I\'m wondering if a wife of one of the owners, and there\'s 30 owners, did something like that, said those racial slurs, would they oust the husband? Or would they leave the husband in?" \n \n Sterling added that the Clippers franchise is her "passion" and "legacy to my family." \n \n "I\'ve been with the team for 33 years, through the good times and the bad times," she added. \n \n These comments come nearly two weeks after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced a lifetime ban and a $2.5 million fine for Donald Sterling on April 29, following racist comments from the 80-year-old, which were caught on tape and released to the media. \n \n Read: Barbara Walters\' Exclusive Interview With V.

"In fact, I have here-- I just filed-- I was going to file the petition. I signed the petition for a divorce. And it came to almost being filed. And then, my financial advisor and my attorney said to me, \'Not now.\'" \n \n Sterling added that she thinks the stalling of the divorce stems from "financial arrangements." \n \n But she said "Eventually, I\'m going to." \n \n She also told Walters she thinks her estranged husband is suffering from "the onset of dementia." \n \n Since Donald Sterling\'s ban, several celebrities have said they would be willing to buy the team from Sterling, including Oprah Winfrey and Magic Johnson. Sterling remains the owner, though his ban means he can have nothing to do with running the team and can\'t attend any games. \n \n Silver announced Friday that former Citigroup chairman and former Time Warner chairman Richard Parsons has been named interim CEO of the team, but nothing concrete in terms of ownership or whether Sterling will be forced to sell the team. Parsons will now take over the basic daily operations for the team and oversee the team\'s president. \n \n Read: What You Need to Know This Week About Donald Sterling \n \n ABC News contacted Donald Sterling for comment on his wife\'s interview, but he declined.

Reaction on the Wall Street Journal\'s MarketBeat Blog was swift: "Woah!!! Bad number." The unemployment rate, however, is better news; it had been expected to hold steady at 8.3%.
